    "en": "This register contains the sub-types of the media type application used for spatial data sets in INSPIRE, in particular in INSPIRE download services. Whenever sub-types exist that are registered with IANA or are in the registration process these are used. For all other formats, no commonly used sub-type exists and INSPIRE has to - at least temporarily - define their own types. In accordance with the rules for media types in RFC 2046/RFC 4288, these start with x-. At this time, all entries in this register have the status 'valid'. Sub-types that are no longer recommended for use will be marked as 'deprecated', but will always be kept in this register as download services may still be using deprecated sub-types."
